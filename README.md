# [Trailbot](https://trailbot.io) Client <sup><sub><sup><sub>DEVELOPER PREVIEW</sub></sup></sub></sup>

__Trailbot tracks your server's logs and files__, triggers [__Smart Policies__](https://github.com/trailbot/client/wiki/Smart-Policies) upon potentially unwanted modifications and generates a __tamper-proof audit trail__ of everything happening in the system.

[Smart Policies](https://github.com/trailbot/client/wiki/Smart-Policies) are simple scripts that get called every time a tracked file changes. They trigger actions such as emailing someone, rolling files back to a previous state or even shutting the system down. There are [plenty of them ready to use](https://github.com/trailbot/client/wiki/Smart-Policies#ready-to-use-policies), and you can even [create your own](https://github.com/trailbot/client/wiki/Smart-Policies).

Trailbot has three components:
+ [__Watcher__](https://github.com/trailbot/watcher): a server daemon that monitors your files and logs, registers file events and enforces [smart policies](https://github.com/trailbot/client/wiki/Smart-Policies).
+ [__Client__](https://github.com/trailbot/client): (this repository) desktop app for managing watchers, defining policies and reading file events.
+ [__Vault__](https://github.com/trailbot/vault): a backend that works as a relay for the watcher's settings and the server events.

# Why Trailbot?

Current security solutions are based on an obsolete paradigm: building walls and fences. Companies advertise their overcomplicated perimeter security systems as if they were impenetrable. But nevertheless we hear everyday about __cyber security breaches__ at even the largest corporations.

In any case walls and fences will not protect you at all from internal breaches and __insider threats__. Furthermore, most data resides nowadays in the cloud, where walls, borders and fences fade and blur. It is not a matter of “if” but “when” the perimeter will get breached.

With Trailbot you can rest assured of the __integrity of your data__, being it a system log or any other important file. It doesn't matter if an outsider got access to your systems or an insider decided to go rogue—__you are now in control__.
